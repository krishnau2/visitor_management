Visitor management
==================

> A web application developed in PHP. The visitorâ€™s details such as their contact details, for what purpose they come for, what are the actions taken by the
company for each visitors etc are all recorded. There is a facility for several search options like.

> * Quick search for a particular visitor by giving their name.

> * Search for the categories of option the visitor may avail during the visit.

> * Search the details of a particular day.

> * Search by the particular action taken by the company to the visitor.

These entire searches are made by AJAX calls to the corresponding model sections and uses MySQL as back-end. There is an Analysis module , which will take the necessary analysis on some parameters such as no of visitors, category, productive and no-productive visitors etc.
